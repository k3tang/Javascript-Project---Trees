# Javascript-Project---Trees

JS Project Proposal: Trees

Background: 
“This is not our world with trees in it. It’s a world of trees, where humans have just arrived.” 
- Richard Powers, The Overstory

Trees have been around for millions of years, silently powering the Earth with life. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the majesty of trees by juxtaposing their presence with our human existence. 

The project begins with an interactive map of famous buildings around the world. When the building is selected, a comparative bar graph of trees to the famous building will appear. Each tree will contain a short biography of its distinct characteristics including height, lifespan, unique fruits or traits, and a photographic image. 

The next interactive segment focuses on the extraordinary lifespan of trees. When the user clicks on certain trees in the bar graph above, an interactive tree-ring will appear. The rings will pair the tree’s lifespan with significant historical events of its native region. 

Lastly, the user can interact with a tree diagram illustrating plant taxonomy. When the user clicks on the child nodes of the diagram, a “seed” will fall and a sapling will appear with a short biography of the selected tree. 

Functionality & MVPs: 
With this data visualization, the user will be able to:
Select buildings to compare tree heights 
Select trees within an interactive bar graph to render more information 
Select specific trees to interact with a tree-ring containing historical events 
Select trees within a tree diagram to render more information
Additionally, the project will contain: 
A production README
A navigation bar

Wireframes:

Navigation bar - includes links to the project’s Github repo and my LinkedIn. It will will also contain ability to navigate between the World Map and Tree Diagram
World map will become the bar graph when a selection is made 
Bar graph will have clickable links to render trees and the tree ring
Tree-ring will appear when an appropriate selection is made. 
Tree diagram will have clickable child nodes


Technologies, Libraries, APIs:
This project will use the following technologies for implementation: 
The Wikipedia API to render historical data 
The Canvas API to render interactive elements
Webpack to bundle the source Javascript code 
Npm for dependency management 

Implementation Timeline: 
Friday and Weekend: Setup project, incorporate Canvas API and Wikipedia API. Create world map, bar graph, tree-ring, and tree diagram scaffold. Incorporate appropriate illustrations and seed data. Get world map and buildings working correctly.

Monday: Start using Wikipedia API to generate information to be rendered in the tree-ring. Ensure that it is working appropriately. 

Tuesday: Ensure the tree diagram is able to be interactive and render appropriate actions of seed falling and tree sapling appearing.

Wednesday: Finish implementation of all three elements and focus on styling. 
Thursday Morning: Deploy to Github.
